Hello, in this article, I will explain the working principle of batteries, which are used in many devices in our daily lives. Additionally, I will talk about the history of batteries, the types of batteries, and the most commonly used battery types today.

## History of Batteries
In 1791, a scientist named Luigi Galvani proposed the theory of animal electricity. According to the theory, the cells that make up living beings contained electricity. Galvani developed this theory when his assistant accidentally touched the legs of a dead frog with both ends of a rod charged with static electricity, causing the dead frog's leg to contract.

Building on this theory, Alessandro Volta realized through his research that the frog's leg acted as an electrolyte. He then conducted the same experiment using a sponge soaked in saltwater instead of a frog and successfully generated an electric current. He then invented the first battery, the Volta battery, by using copper and zinc and placing a cloth or sponge soaked in saltwater between them. Because of Volta's significant invention, the unit of electric potential difference is named Volt in his honor.

## Working Principle of Batteries

A battery is a device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy. It has two terminals: the anode (negative terminal) and the cathode (positive terminal). Electrons gather at the anode, and when a conductor is connected between the two terminals, electrons flow from the anode to the cathode. The basic components inside a battery are a substance for the anode, a substance for the cathode, and an electrolyte placed between these two substances to facilitate the reaction.

*(Internal structure of a battery)*

Different types of batteries emerge from the variation of these three basic components. The structure of the battery can change based on the materials used. Different reactions occur depending on the materials used, and each reaction can produce different voltages. These reactions release electrons, which travel from the anode to the cathode, enabling the battery to function.

## Types of Batteries

Batteries are generally divided into two categories: rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries. Charging a battery means reversing the reaction that occurs when the battery is in use. In other words, when the battery is being charged, electrons move from the cathode to the anode. So, if the working principle of batteries is the same, why can some be recharged while others cannot? The reason is that the reaction in non-rechargeable batteries cannot be reversed or is too risky to do so.

*(Battery during operation and charging)*

Common examples of non-rechargeable batteries include zinc-carbon batteries and the better-performing alkaline batteries. These are typically used in small items and toys that do not require a lot of energy. These batteries are generally cheaper than rechargeable batteries, so their usage rate remains high.

The most commonly used types of rechargeable batteries include lithium metal, the most active material. These are lithium-ion and lithium polymer batteries. Lithium-ion batteries are generally produced in a specific 18650 format and are commonly used in computer batteries, electric cars, and many rechargeable devices. Lithium polymer batteries are very similar to lithium-ion batteries but are much more flexible. Thanks to lithium polymer batteries, phones and computers with thick batteries have become thinner and lighter.

The use of batteries has been increasing recently. Especially in the electric car sector, the most crucial part of the car is its batteries, leading to significant research and development in this area. These efforts are mainly aimed at increasing the capacity and reducing the cost of lithium-ion batteries. Considering that most vehicles will be electric in the near future, I believe that the battery sector will grow significantly more in a short period.
