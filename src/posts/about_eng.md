# Hey, I'm Ahmet 👋

I'm a software engineer based in Turkey with over 3.5 years of experience building web applications, scalable systems, and cloud infrastructure. I love working with modern technologies and solving complex problems that require both creative thinking and technical depth.

My journey in tech started during my Computer Engineering studies at Yildiz Technical University, where I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree as well.

Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on diverse projects — from building high-traffic applications and cloud infrastructure to creating desktop applications for the automotive industry. These experiences have given me a solid foundation in both frontend and backend development, as well as a deep understanding of how to build and maintain systems at scale.

## What I Work With

On the backend side, I primarily work with **Go**, **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **Java** to build robust and efficient services. For frontend development, I use **React.js** to create responsive and intuitive user interfaces.

I'm also passionate about **cloud technologies** and **DevOps practices**. I work extensively with **AWS** and **Azure** for cloud solutions, and I'm experienced in managing containerized applications using **Kubernetes**. I use **Terraform** for infrastructure as code, **Argo CD** for GitOps-based continuous delivery, and **GitHub Actions** for building CI/CD pipelines. Monitoring and observability are also key parts of my workflow, where I rely on tools like **Grafana** to keep systems running smoothly.

For data management and processing, I work with **SQL databases**, **Elasticsearch** for search optimization, **Redis** for caching, and **Apache Airflow** for orchestrating data workflows.

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me at the gym, gaming, or making music. I love staying active and hitting the weights helps me clear my mind after a long day of problem-solving. Gaming has been a passion of mine for years — it's a great way to unwind and connect with friends. I also enjoy producing music and experimenting with different sounds, which brings out a different kind of creativity compared to writing code.

Feel free to reach out — I'm always happy to connect and chat about technology, projects, or anything interesting!
